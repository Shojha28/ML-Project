1. Introduction

1.1	Abstract:

In a worldâ€¦ where movies made an estimated $41.7 billion in 2018, the film industry is more popular than ever. But what movies make the most money at the box office? How much does a director matter? Or the budget? For some movies, it's "You had me at 'Hello.'" For others, the trailer falls short of expectations, and you think "What we have here is a failure to communicate."
In this project, we're presented with metadata on over 3000 past films from The Movie Database to try and predict their overall worldwide box office revenue. Data points provided include cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, posters, release dates, languages, production companies, and countries.

1.2	Objective:

The primary goal is to build a machine-learning model the prediction of revenue that a new movie can generate based on a few given input attributes such as budget, release dates, genres, production companies, production countries, etc. The modeling performance is evaluating based on the MSE and R2
